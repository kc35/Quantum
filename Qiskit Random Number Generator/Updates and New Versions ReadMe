//Qiskit has upgraded and changed a lot of its tools and libraries, so here are the changes
1. Qiskit Aer is changed to "From qiskit.aer import Aer"
2. IBMQ is changed to the method using the IBM Quantum Token and ibm_runtime_service

from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<My_IBM_Quantum_Token>")

3. execute cannot imported anymore and has been changed to "transpile" library. 
4. Qiskit.tools in not directly installed with Qiskit so you pip install Qiskit[tools]
5. Do Not downgrade to older versions as Terra is not supported and will add unnecessary depedencies. 
6. Also since execute function has been removed from older versions than 1.0.0, use backend.run and transpile in that place for example

backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator') //This is the initial code 
    job = transpile(circ, backend)
    result = job.result()
    output = result.get_statevector(circ, decimals=5)

 backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator') //This is the code with the backend.run fix
    circ_ = transpile(circ, backend)
    job = backend.run(circ_)
    result = job.result()
    output = result.get_statevector(circ, decimals=5)
