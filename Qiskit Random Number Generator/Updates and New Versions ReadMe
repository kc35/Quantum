//Qiskit has upgraded and changed a lot of its tools and libraries, so here are the changes
1. Qiskit Aer is changed to "From qiskit.aer import Aer"
2. IBMQ is changed to the method using the IBM Quantum Token and ibm_runtime_service

from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<My_IBM_Quantum_Token>")

3. execute cannot imported anymore and has been changed to "transpile" library. 
4. Qiskit.tools in not directly installed with Qiskit so you pip install Qiskit[tools]
5. downgrade qiskit to 0.20.0 to get ibmq and other libraries as well using "pip install qiskit==0.20.0"
